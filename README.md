# Capacitor-Value-Calculator-Project
  
  DESCRIPTIONS:
  This software was developed as an helpful kit for electricians who wants to calculate the capacitance of a
  capacitor or capacitive reactance of a capacitor, that is suitable for their electronic project development.        
  It also covered calculation of parallel and serial capacitive circuits,in order to know the effective
  capacitance of four capacitors arranged in parallel or in series.
